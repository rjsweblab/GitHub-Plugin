# GitHub Plugin for Pinegrow

This repo accompanies a tutorial for creating a plugin from scratch for Pinegrow. This plugin will integrate GitHub versioning into the Pinegrow App. It is currently planned to have a limited number of commands through the Octokit API, including
- Creating a repo
- Cloning a repo
- Creating a new branch
- Staging changes
- Adding commit messages
- Pushing changes
- Adding pull requests

The plugin will also have the ability to read and write both `.git` and `.gitignore` files

We will also have to add in a control panel for adding our user name and authentication for GitHub

It is hoped that this project will become a collaborative event pointed at increasing everyone's JavaScript skills!
